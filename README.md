Easing of event addition and DOM querrying

## How?
Copy the code somewhere before your other code and then use it in your code.

## Why?
Because using jQuery just to select some elements or managing events is retarded and I'm fresh out of fυсks to give about JS purists being offended by extending prototypes.
